# Tool: Combine Multiple Images to PDF

## Instructions

- Inside `imagesource.txt` paste path to images, one line per one image. Paste in the exact order you want to creaate the PDF.
- Nice little tip: If you're using a Mac, select images and right-click with pressing option key, and you will see `Copy n items as Pathnames`. You can paste that directly.
- Nice little second tip: If you need some sort of sorting you can checkout [tools-sort-text-file-by-line](https://github.com/anaclumos/tools-sort-text-file-by-line).
- If needed change the paper settings in `combine.py` line 13.
- Execute and enjoy
